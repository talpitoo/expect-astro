  <p class="mb-3">
    A TypeScript + React (Next.js 12) single‑page style game exported as a static site and deployed to AWS S3/CloudFront. 
    Real‑time gameplay rendered on an HTML5 <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> with a custom frame throttling hook controlled by dynamic FPS (speed increases as you eat apples).
